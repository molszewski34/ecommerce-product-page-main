## Motivation
Learn how to create features presented in project.

## Technologies 
To build this project i used pure CSS, HTML and Javascript.

- 2 diffrent navigations

## Responsiveness

## Built with

## What I learned

In this challange i learned how to make sliders with basic javasript. Javascrirpt part is mainly made with conditionals and basic operations through array. This is not perfect way especially for slider but it works! :) I also learned that when code has 700+ css code line things start to be messy and i need to start use scss so i can navigate through my code without use of search bar. 

## Future development

Make better sliders with less code. Use grid to make it easier.
